# Drive

The game Drive is a 2D top-down view racing game for one or two people on the same keyboard. One player can play with WASD keys and other with arrow keys.
The point of the game is to get points and make records; there is no definite winning point because you can play the game indefinitely.
One or two cars race on three-lane highways. First, the game starts with car moving slowly but it will get faster every 30 seconds. In addition, on the road there are obstacles, other cars, traffic cones, etc.
When a car crashes, the game is over (for this one player). There is a scoreboard and after crashing the car, if your score is in the top 10, you can insert your name and it stays there.
When playing with two players, there are two roads so that the two cars cannot collide with each other. When one player crashes, it does not influence the otherâ€™s game.
