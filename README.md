# Drive

The game Drive is a 2D top-down view racing game.  
The player can control the car with LEFT ARROW and RIGHT ARROW or A and D keys.  
The objective is to dodge other cars and survive as long as possible. The player car can take maximum of three hits from other cars (the health bar is on the top left corner). There is also a possibility to make more points by catching gold coins that spawn every 15 seconds.  
Over time, enemy cars will start to appear more frequently, making the game harder in time. There is no definite finish, the game can play infinitely.  
When the car crashes after 3 hits, the player sees the scoreboard with top ten scores. If the player's score is in the top 10, they can enter their name in the input field and the scoreboard is refreshed. The saved scores are written in a text file in Resources folder.  
After crashing, the player can choose to replay the game or go to main menu. From there you can also play the game or quit the application.
